# What is this project?
**Disclaimer**: This project is brand new and is still in the design phase. There isn't really any code except for some docker scripts.

This project auto-generates UML diagrams by parsing the source files of a project and creating UML class diagrams structures using the [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) format.

At the moment, the project has a very narrow scope. It's primary goals at the time of this writing are to get a working custom C/C++ parser up and running for use in a separate project. Hopefully the project will last long enough for it to be expanded to other languages.

# Project Details
