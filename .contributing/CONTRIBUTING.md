# Contributing
Here you will find the general workflow of the project, and contribution guidelines and requirements

## Workflow
We use an issue, branch, pull request workflow as you may have seen in other GitHub projects.

This means that the following flow is followed when making any and all contributions to the project:
* Choose an issue to address or make one if your specific issue does not already exist
* Create a branch based on the current version of the master branch to address the issue
* Once that specific issue has been addressed, create a pull request and the code will be reviewed, tested and (hopefully) merged

## Contribution Requirements
This section addresses things that _must_ be present in your pull request/code in order for it to be considered to be merged into the project.

* You must follow the workflow (as seen above) in order to contribute to this project, if any part of the workflow is violate your request for changes will be ignored until the proper procedures are followed
* You must follow the [coding style](./CODE_STYLE.md)
* Test cases must be written (and ideally passing) for all new pieces of code that are being proposed to be merged with the project

## Contribution Guidelines
This section addresses things that would be nice to see in the code, but that are not necessarily required to be reviewed and merged into the project.

* Trim trailing whitespace in files before committing
* Include documentation comments (e.g. @return, @param, etc.) and other explanitory comments in your code
